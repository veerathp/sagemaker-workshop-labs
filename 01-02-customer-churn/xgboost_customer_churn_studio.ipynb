The `data` folder that came with this notebook contains the dataset, which we've already preprocessed for this walkthrough. The dataset has been split into training and validation sets. To see how the dataset was preprocessed, see this notebook: [XGBoost customer churn notebook that starts with the original dataset](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_customer_churn/xgboost_customer_churn.ipynb). \n",

Typically, you need to explore some trade-offs in model performance between a large number of shallow trees and a smaller number of deeper trees.\n",
    "- `subsample` Controls sampling of the training data.  This hyperparameter can help reduce overfitting, but setting it too low can also starve the model of data.\n",
    "- `num_round` Controls the number of boosting rounds.  This value specifies the models that are subsequently trained using the residuals of previous iterations.  Again, more rounds should produce a better fit on the training data, but can be computationally expensive or lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- `eta` Controls how aggressive each round of boosting is.  Larger values lead to more conservative boosting.\n",
    "- `gamma` Controls how aggressively trees are grown.  Larger values lead to more conservative models.\n",
    "- `min_child_weight` Also controls how aggresively trees are grown. Large values lead to a more conservative model.\n",

    "#### Trial 2 - XGBoost in framework mode\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next trial, we'll train a similar model, but use XGBoost in framework mode. If you've worked with the open source XGBoost, using XGBoost this way will be familiar to you. Using XGBoost as a framework provides more flexibility than using it as a built-in algorithm because it enables more advanced scenarios that allow incorporating preprocessing and post-processing scripts into your training script. Specifically, we'll be able to specify a list of rules that we want Amazon SageMaker Debugger to evaluate our training  against."

    "We've made a couple of simple changes to enable the Amazon SageMaker Debugger `smdebug` library. We created a `SessionHook`, which we pass as a callback function when creating a `Booster`. We passed a `SaveConfig` object that tells the hook to save the evaluation metrics, feature importances, and SHAP values at regular intervals. (Debugger is highly configurable. You can choose exactly what to save.) We describe the changes in more detail after we train this example. For even more detail, see the [Developer Guide for XGBoost](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/tree/master/docs/xgboost)."
